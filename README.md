This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Important rules

```bash
    - Never use `npm`, `pnpm` etc. Only `yarn`.
    - Pull requests should be scoped to one feature or fix, except for complex features and flows.
    - All files created under the `component` folder should start with a capital letter.
    - All folders should follow the camel casing, no white space is permitted in their naming.
    - Functions should follow camel casing e.g `addFiles`
    - Commit messages should carry their appropiate flag e.g feat, fix, chore etc. Here is a sample commit command `git commit -m "feat: added input components"`
```

To install project dependencies

```bash
    yarn or yarn install
```
To start the development server

```bash
yarn dev
```

To auto remove linting errors use

```bash
yarn lint:fix
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
